     <p>Maybe its about time.  Laziness and a general lack of motivation will only prevent you from getting anywhere for a few years.  Eventually one does need to return to his or her roots.  And mine are deeply planted in a patch of high-octane earth.

Life is too short to be lollygagging around. -mod</p>
